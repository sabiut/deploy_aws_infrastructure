# Deploy aws infrastructure

This is a python boto 3 application that i wrote and use it to deploy AWS instances on a public and private network. It is using an encrypted AMI that i have created. Before running the the application you need to set a valid AMI.

Before launching the instances, i created a key pairs and then used the key pairs to launch the instances.
